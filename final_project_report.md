# Experimet: Udacity Free Trial Screener
##Experiment Overview

At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the home page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". If the student clicks "start free trial", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.

In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked "start free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.

The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.

The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.

## Experiment Design
### Metric Choice
The following metrics will be used as invariant metrics for sanity check, they shouldn't be affected by experiment (to be sure that experiment is set up well and there is not pre-exisiting differences between control and experiment groups):
  * __Number of cookies__: number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (`dmin=3000`)
  * __Number of clicks__: number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). (`dmin=240`)
  *  __Click-through-probability__: number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (`dmin=0.01`)

The following metrics will be used as evaluation metrics:
  *  __Gross conversion__: number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button. (`dmin= 0.01`)
  *  __Retention__: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. (`dmin=0.01`)
  *  __Net conversion__: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button. (`dmin= 0.0075`)

I am expecting in experiment group to have lower __gross conversion__ (some students will decide to have a free access to material instead of free trial because they won't be committed enough) and higher __retention__ and __net conversion__ (students have correct expectations on course commitment and it's more likely that they will finish the course).

###Measuring Standard Deviation
List the standard deviation of each of your evaluation metrics. (These should be the answers from the "Calculating standard deviation" quiz.)

For each of your evaluation metrics, indicate whether you think the analytic estimate would be comparable to the the empirical variability, or whether you expect them to be different (in which case it might be worth doing an empirical estimate if there is time). Briefly give your reasoning in each case.

###Sizing
####Number of Samples vs. Power
Indicate whether you will use the Bonferroni correction during your analysis phase, and give the number of pageviews you will need to power you experiment appropriately. (These should be the answers from the "Calculating Number of Pageviews" quiz.)

####Duration vs. Exposure
Indicate what fraction of traffic you would divert to this experiment and, given this, how many days you would need to run the experiment. (These should be the answers from the "Choosing Duration and Exposure" quiz.)

Give your reasoning for the fraction you chose to divert. How risky do you think this experiment would be for Udacity?

##Experiment Analysis
###Sanity Checks
For each of your invariant metrics, give the 95% confidence interval for the value you expect to observe, the actual observed value, and whether the metric passes your sanity check. (These should be the answers from the "Sanity Checks" quiz.)

For any sanity check that did not pass, explain your best guess as to what went wrong based on the day-by-day data. Do not proceed to the rest of the analysis unless all sanity checks pass.

###Result Analysis
####Effect Size Tests
For each of your evaluation metrics, give a 95% confidence interval around the difference between the experiment and control groups. Indicate whether each metric is statistically and practically significant. (These should be the answers from the "Effect Size Tests" quiz.)

####Sign Tests
For each of your evaluation metrics, do a sign test using the day-by-day data, and report the p-value of the sign test and whether the result is statistically significant. (These should be the answers from the "Sign Tests" quiz.)

####Summary
State whether you used the Bonferroni correction, and explain why or why not. If there are any discrepancies between the effect size hypothesis tests and the sign tests, describe the discrepancy and why you think it arose.

###Recommendation
Make a recommendation and briefly describe your reasoning.

##Follow-Up Experiment
Give a high-level description of the follow up experiment you would run, what your hypothesis would be, what metrics you would want to measure, what your unit of diversion would be, and your reasoning for these choices.
